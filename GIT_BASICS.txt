Basics:
	- VERSIONS/Flavours:
		-git
		-github-sandwich
		-github
	- developed by Linus for Linux developments (so quite similar to Linux)
	- Very small foot-print
	- can work without a 'proper installation', with just some binaries in the $PATH environment variable
	- command line at its core
	- .git folder
		- Only one '.git'
		- To 'un-git', just delete this directory.
			- hooks
				-files to 'hook' into to do some stuff using scripts
			- info/objects/refs
				- contains actual data for the commits
				- versioned controlled timestamped copies of the rep are stored
	- GIT PROCESS:
		- [LOCAL REPO] git init 		-> git pull (from server repo) 			-> git add (add files locally) 						-> git commit 		-> git push
		=> create '.git' dir locally 	-> get copy of files from server repo	-> add files to 'working copy'/'staging area' 		-> in local copy 	-> push local commits to server repo
	- FEATURES:
        - Anyone can checkout a branch and make local changes
            - the changes can be reviewed and checked-in to the main trunk by someone with access
        - Easy to merge two branches
        - Allows multiple local branches with their own code changes/bug fixes that can then be merged back to the main trunk

	- eg.
		$ git pull https://github.com/dingy007/project_trial1.git
GIT REMOTE ADD:
	- configure the git repository to be able to check into the original repository
	- must provide a name for the repository
	- eg.
		$ git remote add origin https://github.com/dingy007/project_trial1.git

Initialized empty Git repository in /home/dineshkp/git/git_trial/.git/
(create files etc)
GIT ADD:
	-$git add .

GIT COMMIT:
	-$git commit -m "Detailed message about the commit"
GIT STATUS:
	-$git status
GIT BRANCH:
	-Create a new Branch
		-$git branch NewBranch
			- create a new branch called 'NewBranch'
		-$git checkout NewBranch
			- switch to the branch called 'NewBranch'
		-$ git checkout -b NewBranch
	:Switched to a new branch 'NewBranch'
			- create a new branch called 'NewBranch' and switch to it in  one step using the '-b' option
	-Switch to a branch
		-$git checkout another-branch
			- Swtich to the 'another-branch' branch
	-Commit changes from a branch to 'master' branch
			-$git checkout master
				- switch to master branch
			-$git merge another-branch
				- merge the changes from 'another-branch' to the master branch
	- Delete a branch
		-$git branch -d another-branch
			- Delete a branch called 'another-branch'
GIT PUSH:
	- push locally committed changes to online repository
	- have to provide online repo link, unless the '.git/config' file has been updated with the remote repo location
	- $git push -u origin master
GIT DIFF:
	- shows the diff between two versions of a file
	$ git diff
		- shows the diff between working copy vs the local repository
	$ git diff --staged
		- shows the diff between 'staged' directory vs the local repo
	$ git diff master https://github.com/dingy007/FinQueryTool.git
		- shows the diff between the local-master and the remote git (master)
GIT REMOTE:
	- allows creation of a shortcut to a remote repository
	- the shortcut name can be used in other commands instead of typing the full repository path
	$ git remote
		- shows all the shortcuts available
	$ git remote -v
		- shows the shortcuts + URI associated
	$ git remote add finqureyrepo https://github.com/dingy007/FinQueryTool.git
		- creates a shortcut named 'finqueryrepo' for the URI 'https://github.com/dingy007/FinQueryTool.git'
			- this allows the following command:
			$ git diff master finqueryrepo/master
				- comparing the changes in the local-master with the remote repository
	$ 
GIT DELETE FILE:
	$ git rm FileName
		- removes a file from the repository
GIT RENAME/MOVE FILE:
	- 'mv' the file using GIT
		$ git mv oldLocation/oldFileName newLocation/newFileName
			[OR]
	- Rename the file on shell/windows
	- add the 'new' file name to GIT
		$ git add newFileName
	- remove the 'old' file name in GIT
		$ git rm oldFileName
	- do git status (to ensure that GIT understood the Renaming of files)
		$ git status
GIT TAG:
	$git tag -a v1.0.rc1 -m "trial tag"
